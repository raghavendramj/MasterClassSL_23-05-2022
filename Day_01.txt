Agenda - 6 hours
Monday -> 3 hours
	-> 1 Hr -> Java OOPS
	-> 1 Hr -> Java Classes and Interfaces
	-> 1 Hr -> Collection
Wednesday -> 3 hours
		-> 3 hr -> Data Structures
			-> Arrays -> 2 problems
			-> Linked List
				-> 2 prolems
			-> ArraysList and LinkedList
			-> Stacks and Queues

Post session
	-> Bunch of completed questions...

What is a programming Language?


Features
	-> Simple
			based on c++
			automatic garbage collection
	-> Object Oriented Programming Language
		-> Object
		-> Class

	Class
		Fields -> variables
		Methods
		Constructors
		Blocks
		Nested Classes and Interfaces

	Object
		blueprint/instance of a class


Variables
	-> Local Variable
	-> Instance Variable
	-> Static variable

Data Types

	-> byte -> number -> 1 byte 	-> ex. 12, 34, 678
	-> int -> number -> 4 bytes ex. 12, 34, 678
	-> float -> number -> 4 bytes -> 12.45, 34.56, 9.3, 54.0

	private  -> This is only accessible inside the current class
	public -> This can be accessed from anywhere
	protected -> this can be accessed inside the class and same package.
					-> outside the package -> only the child class can access these members
	default -> only inside the current package

	Encapsulation
		-> Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.

	Inheritance
		-> 	Employee
				->salary
				Programmer extends Employee
				DevOpsEngineer extends Employee
				MultiLevel Inheritance
				---------------------------
				Employee -> DevOpsEngineer -> DevOpsSpecialist

				Hierarchical Inheritance
				---------------------------
				Employee -> DevOpsEnginee
								-> Programmer
								
		Polymorphism
			-> Compile time / overloading 
			-> Run time / Overriding					
						
		Abstraction
			 process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
